Application Of Common Machine Learning Methods
By Amy Hoffman

The document provides example applications of regression, classification, clustering, and neural networks using data sets found on Kaggle. Therefore, prior to performing the analysis, I cleaned the data and performed some exploratory data analysis to formulate questions and determine which machine learning method was applicable.

The analysis was performed in R and written up in R Markdown as part of a undergraduate assignment for an Advanced Machine Learning class.
